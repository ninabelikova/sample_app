  <h1>Welcome to the Magnificent Hababa version 2</h1>

  <h2>
    Have you always felt like something is missing from your life?<br>
    Are you still secretly hoping for God to descend and apologize for the various bugs in your game?<br></h2>
    <p>
    (bugs like "money problems", "relationship issues" that our laziest developer of all time absolutely refuses to fix)<br>
    (seriously, you just came down for some relaxing time of playing Human Being, what's with all the bugs and why can't you even adjust your IQ levels? )
    <br></p><br>
    <h2>
    Hababa holds the key to all the answers.
